# Hi, I’m Isaac Buabeng 👋  
**Ecological Data Scientist in training | PhD Student in Plant Biology | Integrating Statistics, Machine Learning into Functional Trait Ecology**  

I’m an ecological data scientist and plant biologist working at the intersection of ecology, statistics, and machine learning to understand how functional and phylogenetic diversity shape community assembly and ecosystem processes. My research integrates trait data, phylogenetic information, and environmental gradients to uncover the mechanisms driving plant biodiversity patterns and their implications for global change.

---
## 🔬 What I Work On
- Building statistical and computational models (GLMs, mixed-effects models, Bayesian frameworks) to study plant functional and phylogenetic diversity
- Developing reproducible trait-based and community ecology workflows in R and Python
- Quantifying trait–environment relationships and their role in structuring plant communities
- Exploring how functional diversity metrics relate to ecological resilience and biogeography

## 🔧 Core Skills & Tools  
- **Languages**: R (tidyverse, lme4, caret), Python (pandas, scikit-learn), SQL  
- **Modelling & Stats**: multiple regression, mixed-effects models, machine learning (random forest, boosting)  
- **Data & Visualization**: tidy data workflow, ggplot2, Shiny dashboards, Tableau  
- **Domain Knowledge**: functional trait ecology, ecology & biodiversity conservation, experimental design  
- **Other tools**: Git, GitHub, Linux command line, reproducible workflows (RMarkdown, Jupyter)
